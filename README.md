# Use-simpleJWT-with-WeChat-Mini-Program
Python Django and WeChat Mini Program

I am doing a project with Python/Django for backend to support WeChat Mini Program as front end. I am here to record those might be valuable to share. So...

Tokens:

To use simplejwt tokens, we need to deal with 3 cases:

1. Generate new tokens (access_token,refresh_token) for new user.

2. Using refresh_token to refresh a new access_token for an exsiting user.

3. Generate new tokens (access_token,refresh_token) for exsiting user in case the user's refresh_token is also expeired.

Almost every request made to backend, you need to take good care of these Tokens, so I put it into a single js file and exported them to outside call. 

One more thing to put here is that wx.request method from WeChat Mini Program is asynchronous, thus I wraped the functions as a Promise.
